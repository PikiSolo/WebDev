    <title>Function scope and closure</title>
    <h1>Scope:</h1>
    <p>Scope determines the accessibility (visibility) of variables.</p>
    <p>Two types of scope in JavaScript:</p>
    <p>1. Local scope</p>
    <p>Local scope is created when a function starts, and deleted when the function is completed.</p>
    <p>2. Global scope</p>
    <p>Global scope is created when JavaScript code is executed, and deleted when the browser window is closed.</p>

    <script>
        var globalVar = "This is a global variable";

        function testScope() {
            var localVar = "This is a local variable";
            document.write("Inside the function: " + localVar +" <br>");
        }

        testScope();
        document.write("Outside the function: " + globalVar);
    </script>

    <script>
        document.write("<br>"+"This is a new block"+ globalVar + "<br>");
    </script>

<h1> Closure </h1>
<p> A closure is a function having access to the parent scope, even after the parent function has closed.</p>
<p> This means a closure can remember and access variables and arguments of its outer function even after the function has finished.</p>

<script>
    var counter = 0;
    function add() {
        //what is add() returning?
        // add returns a function

        
        function plus() {
            counter += 1;
        }
        plus();
        return counter;
    }
    document.write("value from add() " + add() + "<br>");
    add();
    add();
    add();

    document.write("after 5 times of calling add() " + add() + "<br>");
