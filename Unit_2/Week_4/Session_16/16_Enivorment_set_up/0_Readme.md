To configure Visual Studio Code (VSCode) for executing JavaScript code, you can follow these steps:

Install Node.js: Ensure that Node.js is installed on your system. You can download it from the official website (https://nodejs.org) and follow the installation instructions specific to your operating system.

Install the "Code Runner" extension: Open VSCode and navigate to the Extensions view on the sidebar (Ctrl+Shift+X or Cmd+Shift+X). Search for "Code Runner" in the marketplace and install the extension provided by Jun Han.

Create a JavaScript file: Open a new file in VSCode and save it with a .js extension (e.g., myscript.js). This will be the file where you'll write your JavaScript code.

Configure Code Runner: By default, Code Runner should automatically recognize JavaScript files and execute them. However, you can customize the Code Runner settings to your liking. To access the settings, go to File > Preferences > Settings (or use the keyboard shortcut Ctrl+Comma or Cmd+Comma). In the settings search bar, type "code runner" to filter the Code Runner options.

Execute JavaScript code: With your JavaScript file open, you can run the code using one of the following methods:

Press Ctrl+Alt+N or Cmd+Option+N to execute the entire file.
Right-click anywhere in the editor and choose "Run Code" from the context menu.
Use the keyboard shortcut Ctrl+Alt+N or Cmd+Option+N to execute the selected lines of code.
The output of your JavaScript code will be displayed in the Output panel at the bottom of the VSCode window.
