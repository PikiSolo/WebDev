    <h2>What is control statements in Javascript?</h2>
    <p>Control statements are used to control the flow of execution of a program based on certain conditions. <br> JavaScript supports the following control statements:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Conditional Statements</li>
        <li>Looping Statements</li>
        <li>Jump Statements</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>What is conditional statements in Javascript?</h2>

    <p>Conditional statements are used to perform different actions based on different conditions. <br> JavaScript supports the following conditional statements:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>if...else</li>
        <li>switch</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>What is if...else statement in Javascript?</h2>

    <p>The if...else statement is used to execute a block of code based on the condition. <br> If the condition evaluates to true, then the if block of code will be executed, otherwise else block of code will be executed.</p>

    <h3>Example for if else</h3>
    <p>synatax of if..else</p>
    <pre>
        if (condition) {
            // block of code to be executed if the condition is true
        } else {
            // block of code to be executed if the condition is false
        }
    </pre>
    <script>
        var age = 16;
        if (age >= 18) {
            document.write("You are eligible to vote!");
        } else {
            document.write("You are not eligible to vote!");
        }
    </script>

    <h2>What is switch statement in Javascript?</h2>
    <p>The switch statement is used to execute one of the many blocks of code based on the expression.</p>

    <h3>Example for switch</h3>
    <p>synatax of switch</p>
    <pre>
        switch (expression) {
            case value1:
                // block of code to be executed if expression = value1
                break;
            case value2:
                // block of code to be executed if expression = value2
                break;
            ...
            case valueN:
                // block of code to be executed if expression = valueN
                break;
            default:
                // block of code to be executed if expression is different from all values
        }

    </pre>
    <script>
        var day = 8;
        switch (day) {
            case 1:
                document.write("Monday");
                break;
            case 2:
                document.write("Tuesday");
                break;
            case 3:
                document.write("Wednesday");
                break;
            case 4:
                document.write("Thursday");
                break;
            case 5:
                document.write("Friday");
                break;
            case 6:
                document.write("Saturday");
                break;
            case 7:
                document.write("Sunday");
                break;
            default:
                document.write("Invalid day");
        }

    </script>

    <h1>What is looping statements in Javascript?</h1>
    <p>Looping statements are used to execute a block of code repeatedly as long as the condition is true. <br> JavaScript supports the following looping statements:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>for</li>
        <li>while</li>
        <li>do...while</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>What is for loop in Javascript?</h2>
    <p>The for loop is used to execute a block of code for a specified number of times.</p>

    <h3>Example for for loop</h3>
    <p>synatax of for loop</p>
    <pre>
        for (initialization; condition; increment/decrement) {
            // block of code to be executed
        }
    </pre>

    <script>
        for (var i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
            document.write(i + "<br>");
        }
    </script>

    <h2>What is while loop in Javascript?</h2>
    <p>The while loop is used to execute a block of code as long as the condition is true.</p>

    <h3>Example for while loop</h3>
    <p>synatax of while loop</p>
    <pre>
        while (condition) {
            // block of code to be executed
        }
    </pre>

    <script>
        var i = 1;
        while (i <= 5) {
            document.write(i + "<br>");
            i++;
        }
    </script>

    <h2>What is do...while loop in Javascript?</h2>
    <p>The do...while loop is used to execute a block of code as long as the condition is true. <br> The block of code will be executed once before the condition is checked.</p>

    <h3>Example for do...while loop</h3>
    <p>synatax of do...while loop</p>
    <pre>
        do {
            // block of code to be executed
        } while (condition);
    </pre>

    <script>
        var i = 1;
        do {
            document.write(i + "<br>");
            i++;
        } while (i <= 5);
    </script>

    <h1>What is jump statements in Javascript?</h1>
    <p>Jump statements are used to transfer the control of the program to a specific statement. <br> JavaScript supports the following jump statements:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>break</li>
        <li>continue</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>What is break statement in Javascript?</h2>
    <p>The break statement is used to terminate the loop or switch statement and transfer the control over the next statement.</p>

    <h3>Example for break statement</h3>
    <p>synatax of break statement</p>
    <pre>
        break;

    </pre>

    <script>
        for (var i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
            if (i == 3) {
                break;
            }
            document.write(i + "<br>");
        }
    </script>

    <h2>What is continue statement in Javascript?</h2>

    <p>The continue statement is used to terminate the current iteration of the loop and continue with the next one.</p>

    <h3>Example for continue statement</h3>
    <p>synatax of continue statement</p>
    <pre>
        continue;

    </pre>

    <script>
        for (var i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
            if (i == 3) {
                continue;
            }
            document.write(i + "<br>");
        }
    </script>
