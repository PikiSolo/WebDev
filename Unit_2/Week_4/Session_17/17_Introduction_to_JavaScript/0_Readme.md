//introduction to Javascript 
What is javascript ?
Javascript is a programming language that adds interactivity to your website. This happens in games, in the behavior of responses when buttons are pressed or with data entry on forms; with dynamic styling; with animation, etc. This class is a first step towards learning Javascript programming. You will learn the basics of the language, and how to use it to make your website better. This class should be taken after: HTML and CSS.

What is Javascript used for?
JavaScript is a scripting or programming language that allows you to implement complex features on web pages — every time a web page does more than just sit there and display static information for you to look at — displaying timely content updates, interactive maps, animated 2D/3D graphics, scrolling video jukeboxes, etc. — you can bet that JavaScript is probably involved. It is the third layer of the layer cake of standard web technologies, two of which (HTML and CSS) we have covered in much more detail in other parts of the Learning Area.

JavaScript is one of the 3 languages all web developers must learn:

    1. HTML to define the content of web pages
    2. CSS to specify the layout of web pages
    3. JavaScript to program the behavior of web pages
