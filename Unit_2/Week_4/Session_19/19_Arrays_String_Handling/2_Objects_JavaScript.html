    <h2>What is Objects in Javascript?</h2>
    <p>Objects are variables too. But objects can contain many values.</p>
    <p>Think of an object as a list of values that are written as name:value pairs, with the names and the values separated by colons.</p>
    <p>Object properties are written as name:value pairs, separated by commas.</p>

<h2>Example of Accessing Object Properties</h2>
<script>
    var person = {firstName:"Guru", lastName:"Prakash", age:50, eyeColor:"black"};
    
    document.write(person.firstName + " is " + person.age + " years old.");
</script>

<h2>Example of Adding New Properties</h2>
<script>    

//adding properties to an object
var person = {firstName:"Guru", lastName:"Prakash", age:50, eyeColor:"black" , fullName : function() {return this.firstName + " " + this.lastName;}};
document.write("ex of adding Accessing Object Properties >  " + person.fullName());
</script>

<h2>Example of Deleting Properties</h2>

<h2>Example of Object Definition</h2>
<script>
    function person(first, last, age, eye) {
        this.firstName = first;

    </script>

<h2>Example of Object Constructors</h2>
<script>
//object constructor
function car(Brand, Color, Type, Price) {
    this.Brand = Brand;
    this.Color = Color;
    this.Type = Type;
    this.Price = Price;
}

//creating object
var myCar = new car("Maruti", "White", "SUV", 1000000);
