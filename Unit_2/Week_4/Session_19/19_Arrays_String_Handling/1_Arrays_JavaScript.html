    <h2>What are array in JS?</h2>
    <p> 
        An array is a special variable, which can hold more than one value at a time.
        If you have a list of items (a list of car names, for example), storing the cars in single variables could look like this:
<br>
        var car1 = "Saab";
        var car2 = "Volvo";
        var car3 = "BMW";
<br>
        However, what if you want to loop through the cars and find a specific one? And what if you had not 3 cars, but 300?
<br>
        The solution is an array!
        An array can hold many values under a single name, and you can access the values by referring to an index number.

<h2>Array example</h2>
<h3>Synatax for Array</h3>
<p>
    var array_name = [item1, item2, ...];<br>
    var cars = ["KIA", "Volvo", "BMW"];
</p>

<h2>Array Example </h2>
<script>
    var cars = ["KIA", "Volvo", "BMW"];
    document.write(cars[0]);
    document.write("<br>");
    document.write(cars[1]);
    document.write("<br>");
    document.write(cars[2]);

</script>

<h2>Operation that can be performed on Array</h2>
<p>
    <ul>
        <li>Push</li>
        <li>Pop</li>
        <li>Shift</li>
        <li>Unshift</li>
        <li>Splice</li>
        <li>Concat</li>
        <li>Sort</li>
        <li>Reverse</li>
    </ul>

<h2>Example of opeations that can be performed on Array</h2>

<script>
    //Push
    var fruits = ["Banana", "Orange", "Apple", "Mango"];
    document.write(fruits); 
    document.write("<br>");
    fruits.push("Kiwi");
    document.write("Push > " + fruits);
    document.write("<br>");
//What did puch do to the array fruits?
//It added a new element to the end of the array

    
    //Pop

    fruits.pop();
    document.write("Pop > " + fruits);
    document.write("<br>");
//What did pop do to the array fruits?
//It removed the last element from the array


    //Shift
    fruits.shift();
    document.write("Shift > " +fruits);
    document.write("<br>");
    //What did shift do to the array fruits?
    //It removed the first element from the array

    //Unshift
    fruits.unshift("Lemon");
    document.write("Unshift>" + fruits);
    document.write("<br>");
    //What did unshift do to the array fruits?
    //It added a new element to the beginning of the array

    //Splice
    fruits.splice(2, 0, "Lemon", "Kiwi");   
    document.write("Splice>" + fruits);
    document.write("<br>");
    //What did splice do to the array fruits?
    //It removed "Apple" and "Mango" and added "Lemon" and "Kiwi"

    //Concat
    var myGirls = ["Ann", "Lucy", "Mary"];
    var myBoys = ["Tom", "Jerry", "Jack"];
    var myChildren = myGirls.concat(myBoys);
    document.write("Concat > " + myChildren);
    document.write("<br>");

    //What did concat do to the array?
    //It joined two arrays

    //Sort
    var fruits = ["Banana", "Orange", "Apple", "Mango"];
    document.write(fruits);
    document.write("<br>");
    fruits.sort();
    document.write("Sort>" + fruits);
    document.write("<br>");
    //What did sort do to the array fruits?
    //It sorted the array in alphabetical order

    //Reverse
    var fruits = ["Banana", "Orange", "Apple", "Mango"];
    document.write(fruits);
    document.write("<br>");
    //What did reverse do to the array fruits?
    //It reversed the order of the array
    fruits.reverse();
    document.write("Reverse" + fruits);
    document.write("<br>");
