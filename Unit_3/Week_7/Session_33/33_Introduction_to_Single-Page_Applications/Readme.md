2.	Introduction to Single-Page Applications
•	What are Single-Page Applications (SPAs)?
SPAs is a web application that fits on a single web page with the goal of providing a more fluid user experience akin to a desktop application. In a SPA, either all necessary code – HTML, JavaScript, and CSS – is retrieved with a single page load, or the appropriate resources are dynamically loaded and added to the page as necessary, usually in response to user actions. The page does not reload at any point in the process, nor does control transfer to another page, although the location hash or the HTML5 History API can be used to provide the perception and navigability of separate logical pages in the application. Interaction with the single page application often involves dynamic communication with the web server behind the scenes.

•	Advantages of SPAs over traditional multi-page applications
Advantage of SPAs over traditional multi-page applications include:
Reduced page load time – only the required data is loaded from the server
Reduced server load – only the required data is loaded from the server
Improved user experience – no page reloads
Improved code organization and maintainability – code is organized into modules

•	Explaining the concept of a single-page application flow
Single page application flow is the process of loading a single HTML page and dynamically updating that page as the user interacts with the application. This approach avoids interruption of the user experience between successive pages, making the application behave more like a desktop application. In a SPA, either all necessary code – HTML, JavaScript, and CSS – is retrieved with a single page load, or the appropriate resources are dynamically loaded and added to the page as necessary, usually in response to user actions. The page does not reload at any point in the process, nor does control transfer to another page, although the location hash or the HTML5 History API can be used to provide the perception and navigability of separate logical pages in the application. Interaction with the single page application often involves dynamic communication with the web server behind the scenes.
