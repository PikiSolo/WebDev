        <p> Directives in AngularJS</p>
        <p>AngularJS extends HTML with ng-directives.</p>
        <p>The ng-app directive defines an AngularJS application.</p>
        <p>The ng-model directive binds the value of HTML controls (input, select, textarea) to application data.</p>
        <p>The ng-bind directive binds application data to the HTML view.</p>
        <p>The ng-init directive initializes application data.</p>
        <p>The ng-repeat directive repeats HTML elements for each item in a collection.</p>
        <p>The ng-switch directive binds application data to groups of HTML elements.</p>
        <p>The ng-style directive binds the values of CSS properties to application data.</p>
        <p>The ng-if directive removes and recreates HTML elements based on application data.</p>
        <p>The ng-show directive shows or hides HTML elements based on application data.</p>
        <p>The ng-hide directive hides HTML elements based on application data.</p>
        <p>The ng-click directive defines an AngularJS click event.</p>
        <p>The ng-submit directive binds application data to the HTML submit event.</p>
        <p>The ng-animate directive is used to animate HTML elements in AngularJS.</p>
        <p>The ng-class directive is used to dynamically set CSS classes.</p>
        <p>The ng-view directive is used to create Single Page Applications (SPA).</p>
        <p>The ng-include directive is used to include HTML from an external file.</p>
        <p>The ng-switch directive is used to conditionally swap DOM structure on your template based on a scope expression.</p>
        <p>The ng-controller directive attaches a controller class to the view.</p>
        <p>The ng-repeat directive repeats a set of HTML, a given number of times.</p>
        <p>The ng-cloak directive is used to prevent the AngularJS html template from being briefly displayed by the browser in its raw (uncompiled) form while your application is loading.</p>
        <p>The ng-bind-html directive binds application data to the HTML view, while sanitizing the input.</p>
        <p>The ng-bind-template directive binds application data defined in the directive to the HTML view.</p>
        <p>The ng-disabled directive binds application data to the disabled attribute of HTML elements.</p>
        <p>The ng-open directive binds application data to the open attribute of the HTML details element.</p>
        <p>The ng-readonly directive binds application data to the readonly attribute of HTML elements.</p>
        <p>The ng-selected directive binds application data to the selected attribute of HTML elements.</p>
        <p>The ng-src directive binds application data to the src attribute of the HTML img element.</p>
        <p>The ng-srcset directive binds application data to the srcset attribute of the HTML img element.</p>
        <p>The ng-href directive binds application data to the href attribute of the HTML a element.</p>
        <p>The ng-trustAs directive is used to mark a HTML string as trusted.</p>
        
        <p>Dependency Injecting in AngularJS</p>
        <p>Dependency Injection is a software design pattern that deals with how components get hold of their dependencies.</p> 
        <p>The Angular injector subsystem is in charge of creating components, resolving their dependencies, and providing them to other components as requested.</p>   
        <p>AngularJS has built-in support for dependency injection which helps the developer to develop the application in a modular way and also helps in testing the application.</p>
        <p>AngularJS provides the following ways to implement dependency injection:</p> 
        <p>Using the $injector object</p>
        <p>Using the inline array annotation</p>
        <p>Using the $inject property annotation</p>
        <p>Using the $provide factory method</p>
        
        <p>MVC in AngularJS</p>
        <p>AngularJS is a MVC framework. MVC stands for Model View Controller.</p>  
        <p>Model: It is the lowest level of the pattern responsible for maintaining data.</p>   
        <p>View: It is responsible for displaying all or a portion of the data to the user.</p>
        <p>Controller: It is a software Code that controls the interactions between the Model and View.</p>
        <p>AngularJS uses the MVC pattern to separate the different aspects of the application (input logic, business logic, and UI logic), while providing a loose coupling between these elements.</p>
        <p>AngularJS splits an application into MVC components in the following way:</p>
        <p>How is Model implemenetd in AngularJS?</p>
        <p>Model is implemented in AngularJS by using a JavaScript object. The JavaScript object contains the attributes that are used in the application.</p>
        <p>How is View implemenetd in AngularJS?</p>
        <p>View is implemented in AngularJS by using HTML. The HTML combines with the data and the result is displayed in the View.</p>
        <p>How is Controller implemenetd in AngularJS?</p>
        <p>Controller is implemented in AngularJS by using JavaScript functions. The JavaScript functions contain the business logic behind the application to which the scope objects refer to.</p>    
        <p>AngularJS provides the following features to support the Model View Controller pattern:</p>
        
        <p>Scope: These are objects that refer to the model. They act as a glue between controller and view.</p>
        <p>Controller: These are JavaScript functions that are bound to a particular scope.</p>
        <p>Services: AngularJS comes with several built-in services for example $https: to make a XMLHttpRequests. These are singleton objects which are instantiated only once in app.</p>
        <p>Filters: These select a subset of items from an array and returns a new array.</p>
        <p>Directives: Directives are markers on DOM elements (such as elements, attributes, css, and more). These can be used to create custom HTML tags that serve as new, custom widgets. AngularJS has built-in directives (ngBind, ngModel...)</p>
        <p>Templates: These are the rendered view with information from the controller and model. These can be a single file (like index.html) or multiple views in one page using "partials".</p>
        <p>Routing: It is concept of switching views.</p>
