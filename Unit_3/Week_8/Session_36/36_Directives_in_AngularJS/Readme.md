Example MVC in AngularJS

## 1. MVC in AngularJS
- AngularJS is a MVC framework for web application development.

- MVC stands for Model, View and Controller.

- Model: In angualejs Model represents an object or data. It can also represent a database table or some object. It can also be some kind of user defined data structure.

- View: View represents the visualization of the data that model contains.

- Controller: Controller acts on both model and view. It controls the data flow into model object and updates the view whenever data changes. It keeps view and model separate.     

## 2. AngularJS MVC Architecture
- AngularJS MVC architecture is based on the following three important parts.

- Model: Model represents the shape of the data and business logic. It maintains the data of the application. Model objects retrieve and store model state in the persistance store like a database.

- View: View is a user interface. View display data using model to the user and also enables them to modify the data.

- Controller: Controller handles the user request. Typically, user interact with view, view raise events, controller response to those events and interact with model and update the view as per model state.

## 3. AngularJS MVC Example
- Let's see the simple example of AngularJS MVC architecture.

- In this example, we are going to create a simple student model and view. The controller will handle the request and update the view as per model state.
