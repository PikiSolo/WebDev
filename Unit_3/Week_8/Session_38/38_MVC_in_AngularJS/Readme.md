What is MVC in angularjs?

MVC stands for Model View Controller. It is a software design pattern for developing web applications. It contains three parts: Model, View, and Controller. The Model represents the data, or more specifically the business logic necessary to manipulate the data in the application. The View is the user interface, which displays the data. The Controller handles the input from the user, converting it to commands which manipulate the data.

MVC in angularjs example

The following example shows how to use MVC in angularjs:

angular.module('myApp', [])

.controller('MyController', ['$scope', function($scope) {
  $scope.greeting = 'Hola!';
}]);

In the above example, the controller function is passed an array of strings, which are the names of the dependencies to inject. The last element in the array is the controller function itself, and the names of the dependencies are listed before it. The injector will create the dependencies and pass them to the controller function as arguments in the same order as the names in the array.

What is the difference between MVC and MVVM in angularjs?

MVC stands for Model View Controller. It is a software design pattern for developing web applications. It contains three parts: Model, View, and Controller. The Model represents the data, or more specifically the business logic necessary to manipulate the data in the application. The View is the user interface, which displays the data. The Controller handles the input from the user, converting it to commands which manipulate the data.

MVVM stands for Model View ViewModel. It is a software design pattern for developing web applications. It contains three parts: Model, View, and ViewModel. The Model represents the data, or more specifically the business logic necessary to manipulate the data in the application. The View is the user interface, which displays the data. The ViewModel is the glue between the View and the Model, and handles the input from the user, converting it to commands which manipulate the data.
