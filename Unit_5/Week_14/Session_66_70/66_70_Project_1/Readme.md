Blogging System Build Guide
This guide will help you create a simple blogging system using PHP and MySQL. Follow the steps below to build your own blogging platform from scratch.

Prerequisites
Web Server: You need a web server environment ( Apache) with PHP and MySQL installed. You can use XAMPP, WAMP, or similar packages for local development.

Text Editor: Choose a code editor or IDE of your choice (Visual Studio Code).

Database: Ensure you have a MySQL database server set up.

Step 1: Database Setup
Create a new database for your blogging system. You can use a tool like phpMyAdmin or run SQL commands in your MySQL client.

sql

CREATE DATABASE blog_system;
USE blog_system;

Create the necessary tables for your blogging system by executing the SQL code provided in the "Database Structure" section of this README.

Database Structure
USE blog_system;

CREATE TABLE users (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    username VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    email VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    password VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL
);

CREATE TABLE blogs (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    title VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    content TEXT NOT NULL,
    author_id INT NOT NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

CREATE TABLE comments (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    blog_id INT NOT NULL,
    user_id INT NOT NULL,
    comment TEXT NOT NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

Step 2: User Registration and Login
Create a registration form for users to sign up.

register.php: HTML form for user registration.
register_process.php: PHP script to process registration data and store it in the database.
Create a login form for users to log in.

login.php: HTML form for user login.
login_process.php: PHP script to handle user authentication.

Step 3: User Dashboard
After a successful login, users should be directed to a dashboard.

dashboard.php: Dashboard page displaying user-specific content.

Step 4: Create a New Blog
Implement a form for users to create new blog posts.

new_blog.php: HTML form for creating a new blog post.
create_blog.php: PHP script to insert the blog post into the database.

Step 5: View All Blogs
Create a page to display all the blogs.

view_blogs.php: Page for viewing all blog posts.

Step 6: User Comments (Optional)
If desired, you can implement a system for users to comment on blog posts.

create_comment.php: PHP script to add comments to blog posts.
view_comments.php: Page for viewing comments on a blog post.

Step 7: Logout
Implement a logout feature to end a user's session.

logout.php: PHP script to log the user out and destroy the session.

Step 8: Styling and Additional Features (Optional)
Enhance the design of your blogging system using CSS.

Implement features like user profile pages, editing/deleting blog posts, and user authentication using email verification.

Step 9: Security and Deployment
Ensure your application is secure against SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and other common web vulnerabilities.

Deploy your blogging system on a web hosting platform or server of your choice.

Step 10: Testing and Maintenance
Thoroughly test your blogging system to ensure it works as expected.

Regularly maintain and update your application to fix bugs and security issues.
