step-by-step instructions for setting up the Visual Studio Code (VSCode) environment for HTML code development:

Install Visual Studio Code: Download and install Visual Studio Code from the official website (https://code.visualstudio.com). Choose the appropriate installer for your operating system and follow the installation instructions.

Open Visual Studio Code: Once installed, launch Visual Studio Code.

Install Extensions: VSCode has a rich extension ecosystem that can enhance your HTML development experience. To install extensions, follow these steps:

Click on the Extensions icon in the left sidebar (or press Ctrl+Shift+X).
In the search bar, type "HTML" and press Enter.
Look for the "HTML" extension by Microsoft and click on the "Install" button.


Preview HTML: To preview your HTML code inside VSCode, follow these steps:
Install the "html preview" extension by Thomas Haakon. This will help us to preview HTML files while editing them in VSCode.The extension can be activated in two ways
Toggle Preview - ctrl+shift+v or cmd+shift+v
Open Preview to the Side - ctrl+k v or cmd+k v

Live Server : Install the "Live Server" extension by Ritwick Dey from the Extensions marketplace.
Right-click inside the HTML file editor and select "Open with Live Server".
A new browser window will open, displaying the rendered HTML page.
Start Coding: You are now ready to start coding your HTML page. You can edit the HTML code inside VSCode, save the file (Ctrl+S), and the changes will be automatically reflected in the browser preview.

Create a New HTML File: To create a new HTML file, follow these steps:
Click on the Explorer icon in the left sidebar (or press Ctrl+Shift+E).
Right-click on a directory where you want to create the HTML file.
Select "New File" and name the file with the .html extension, for example, "index.html".
HTML Boilerplate: To quickly generate an HTML boilerplate code, use the "html" snippet. Here's how:

Inside the newly created HTML file, type ! and press Tab. This will expand the "html" snippet.
The snippet will generate the basic structure of an HTML document.
